This is a knowledge testing react project in order to gain some extra practice and sharpen skills within react and using useState.

This project is loosely based on a challenge done within another course where the goal was to build a simple application that took a bill cost, and took the average of two percentages passed through in order to calculate a tip for the bill. The deliverables of the challenge are to display a total cost, the bill, and the calculated tip. These components are updated as the inputs placed in are changed. In order to build upon this project, first the basic application will be built out on these deliverables and then the goal is to make it more dynamic where the number of percentages passed through can be changed from two, to be based on the size of a group. For example: One day you want to use the application to calculate a tip based on you and a friend but the next day you want to use the application to calculate a tip based on you and three friends so you need the average of four percentages passed through.

Basic concept:
What is the bill? \_\_\_\_

How many people in the party? 4

How did you like the meal {person num}? \_**\_
How did you like the meal {person num}? \_\_**
How did you like the meal {person num}? \_**\_
How did you like the meal {person num}? \_\_**

Your total is \_\_\_\_ ({bill} + {bill \* ((sum of percentages / people in the party) / 100)})

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
